# Lab03-WordGuessGame
A word guessing game

## Challenge

The main idea of this “Word Guess Game” is to guess a mystery word by inputting 1 letter at a time. The game saves all guesses (both correct and incorrect) throughout each session of the game, along with how many letters out of the words are guessed correctly.

Each time a new game session starts, the mystery word chosen comes from an external text file that randomly selects one of the words listed. This bank of words is editable with view, add, and delete word functionality. This game has a simple user interface that is easy to navigate.

## Solution

I added methods for reading and writing to a file. I added methods for managing the game interface, admin, and game play.
